Want to verify that lword reliably indicates the province in question.
e.g. with "Territories", which we think means NWT...
    lword %>%
        filter(lword == "Territories") %>%
        select(PRJCT_EN_DESC) %>%
        filter(! str_detect(PRJCT_EN_DESC, "Northwest"))
... should return 0.

In some cases, we get multiple results. e.g. "Columbia" can also mean...
    the country
    District of Columbia
... we need then a second filtering step:
    filter(lword == "Columbia") %>%
    filter(! str_detect(PRJCT_EN_DESC, "British")) %>%
    filter(! str_detect(PRJCT_EN_DESC, "District of|Bogota"))
