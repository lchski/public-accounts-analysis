Want to verify that lword reliably indicates the province in question.
e.g. with "Territories", which we think means NWT...
    lword %>%
        filter(lword == "Territories") %>%
        select(PRJCT_EN_DESC) %>%
        filter(! str_detect(PRJCT_EN_DESC, "Northwest"))
... should return 0.

In some cases, we get multiple results. e.g. "Columbia" can also mean...
    the country
    District of Columbia
... we need then a second filtering step:
    filter(lword == "Columbia") %>%
    filter(str_detect(PRJCT_EN_DESC, "British|Brtish")) %>%
    filter(! str_detect(PRJCT_EN_DESC, "District of|Bogota"))

Same with Colombia:
    filter(lword == "Colombia") %>%
    filter(str_detect(PRJCT_EN_DESC, "British|Brtish|Bristish")) %>%
    filter(! str_detect(PRJCT_EN_DESC, "District of|Bogota"))

Use this to clean up once you think you're done:
    lword %>%
        select(lword) %>%
        anti_join(canadian_regions_index, by = c("lword" = "region_lword")) %>%
        count_group(lword) %>%
        View()
